installation guide:

Ensure Python is installed: Make sure Python is installed on the user's system. You can recommend using Python 3.x, preferably version 3.6 or higher, as your Lime script may have specific compatibility requirements.

Install pip: Check if pip is already installed by running the following command in the terminal:

shell

Copy code

pip --version

If pip is not installed, you can provide instructions for installing it based on the user's operating system. For example:

On Linux or macOS, recommend using the package manager, such as apt or brew, to install pip:

shell

Copy code

# Linux (Debian-based)

sudo apt-get install python3-pip

# macOS (Homebrew)

brew install python@3

On Windows, guide users to download the official Python installer from the Python website, which includes pip by default.

Install the dependencies: Provide the command to install the required dependencies using pip. Users can run the following command in the terminal:

shell

Copy code

pip install -r requirements.txt

This command will download and install the openai, argparse, and pytube modules from the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository.

Note: You can also specify the specific versions of the dependencies by adding ==version_number after each package name in the pip install command if your Lime script has strict version requirements.

Verify the installation: Users can verify if the dependencies were installed successfully by running the following command:

shell

Copy code

pip list

This command will display a list of installed packages, including openai, argparse, and pytube, among others.

Ensure to provide clear instructions tailored to the user's operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and include any additional steps or considerations specific to your Lime script or the dependencies.
